				<p>I was born in 1970 and the world hardly noticed, but they would eventually. Very soon after finding out that I coulnd't actually become Spider-Man I decided I wanted to at least study science (and business, and theater, and education.) I was not great at studying all these things right away and joined the Army for a number of years. After the Army, and going back to school for Zoology I wasn't sure what I wanted to do.
